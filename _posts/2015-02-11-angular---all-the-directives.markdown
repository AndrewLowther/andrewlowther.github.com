Recently we've been tasked with building a site using [entirely Angular directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) which has proved an interesting approach to take on for a web project.

Over the coming few weeks I'm hoping to document that process via various posts on this website, and give people a little insight in how the process could potentially work for them if they need to achieve something similar.

Until next time.
